# Fake News Detection

A machine learning project for detecting fake news using natural language processing and classification techniques.

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a robust model to identify fake news articles. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, the goal is to create an accurate classifier that can distinguish between reliable and unreliable news sources.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and preprocessed textual data to handle noise, irrelevant information, and inconsistencies.
- **NLP Techniques:** Implemented natural language processing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and vectorization to convert textual data into a format suitable for machine learning models.
- **Feature Engineering:** Engineered relevant features to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between fake and real news.
- **Model Selection:** Explored and compared different classification algorithms, selecting the one that best suits the characteristics of the dataset.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Trained the chosen model using labeled datasets and evaluated its performance on a separate test set.
- **Explanatory Analysis:** Conducted analyses to interpret the model's predictions and understand key factors influencing fake news detection.
